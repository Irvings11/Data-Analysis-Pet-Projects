# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Analysis

Welcome to my project on analyzing customer churn in a telecom company! 
Have you ever wondered why some customers leave a service while others stay for years? In this project, I dive into real customer data to find out what drives churn, visualize important patterns, and build a machine learning model that predicts which customers are likely to leave.
The goal? To help the company reduce churn by understanding whoâ€™s at risk and suggesting strategies like offering better contracts or personalized promotions.

## What I did

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to spot patterns between customer behavior and churn.
- **Feature engineering** to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Built and evaluated classification models** (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest) to predict churn.
- **Visualized insights** to make the results easy to understand for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Highlights of the analysis

- **Total customer overview**
  - Calculated the total number of customers, how many churned (`Churn=Yes`), and how many stayed (`Churn=No`).
  - Computed the churn rate as:
    ```
    churn rate = number of churned customers / total customers
    ```

- **Feature insights**
  - Plotted histograms and boxplots to compare key features like tenure, monthly charges, and more against churn.
  - Explored questions such as:
    - Do males and females churn at different rates?
    - Are seniors more likely to churn?
    - How does the type of contract (month-to-month vs one/two years) affect churn? Spoiler: churn tends to be higher for month-to-month contracts.

## ðŸ“¸ Example visualization

Hereâ€™s a sample plot from the analysis â€” it shows churn rate by contract type (replace this with your actual plot if needed):
