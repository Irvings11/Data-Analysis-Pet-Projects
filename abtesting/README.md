# A/B Test Analysis on Website User Behavior

Hi there! Welcome to my project analyzing an A/B test dataset collected from website visitors across different locations in the UK. The dataset includes user interactions like page views, time spent on the site, conversions, and device types â€” perfect for uncovering patterns in user behavior.

The main goal of this project is to compare two groups (A and B) to determine which one performs better in terms of conversions, and to understand what factors might influence user engagement and purchasing behavior.

---

## What I explored

- **User behavior patterns** in Groups A and B: comparing average page views, time spent, and conversion rates.
- **Conversion rate analysis** to see which group converts better overall.
- **Device impact**: does conversion performance vary between mobile and desktop users?
- **Location breakdown**: are users from different UK regions behaving differently?

---

## Highlights of the analysis

- **Group comparison**
  - Calculated conversion rates for Group A and Group B.
  - Analyzed average page views and time spent for each group.

- **Device insights**
  - Compared conversion rates between desktop and mobile users across both groups.

- **Regional differences**
  - Explored whether users from England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland have different engagement patterns.
